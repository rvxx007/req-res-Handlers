# req-res-Handlers


## resFunc

The `resFunc` function is designed to send a structured JSON response to the client. This function is particularly useful in web applications built using frameworks like Express.

### Function Signature

```javascript
resFunc(res, statusCode, success, msg, body)
```

### Parameters

- **res (Object)**:  
  The response object from your web framework (e.g., Express).

- **statusCode (Number)**:  
  The HTTP status code to return (e.g., `200` for success, `404` for not found).

- **success (Boolean)**:  
  Indicates whether the response is successful (`true`) or not (`false`).

- **msg (String)**:  
  A message to communicate to the client, which can be a success message or an error description.

- **body (Object)**:  
  The data to be sent as part of the response. This can include any relevant information the client needs.

### Example Usage

```javascript
resFunc(res, 200, true, "Request was successful", { data: "Your data here" });
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the `res` object is a valid response object from your framework.
- The function can be tailored to suit specific needs by modifying the structure of the `msg` or `body`.

## catchFunc

The `catchFunc` function is designed to handle error responses in web applications. It sends a structured error message to the client, making it easier to debug and understand issues.

### Function Signature

```javascript
catchFunc(res, statusCode, msg, error)
```

### Parameters

- **res (Object)**:  
  The response object from your web framework (e.g., Express).

- **statusCode (Number)**:  
  The HTTP status code to return (e.g., `500` for a server error).

- **msg (String)**:  
  A message for the client that provides information regarding the error.

- **error (Object)**:  
  The error object received from a catch block, which contains details about the error.

### Example Usage

```javascript
import { catchFunc } from 'response-utils';

catchFunc(response, 500, 'An error occurred', { error: 'Internal Server Error' });
```

### Integration Example

Hereâ€™s how you might use `catchFunc` in an Express route:

```javascript
app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
    fetchData()
        .then(data => {
            resFunc(res, 200, true, 'Data fetched successfully', data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            catchFunc(res, 500, 'An error occurred', error);
        });
});
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the `res` object is a valid response object from your framework.
- The error object can contain any relevant information that can help in debugging.
